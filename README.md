# DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE!!!

## REALLY, DO NOT USE IT!!!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ingenerator/kohana-core.svg?branch=4.2.x)](https://travis-ci.org/ingenerator/kohana-core)

This is a runaway fork of the now-abandoned [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/) PHP framework.

We've forked it to allow us to support PHP7, drop old code we're no longer using, and gradually move away 
from Kohana in the variety of legacy apps we support.

**IT IS NOT IN ANY WAY GUARANTEED TO BE BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE** with the official Kohana releases. It is
stable, but we are actively removing and rewriting elements to suit our exit strategy. There is no guarantee
anything here will work for you.

Worse, most releases will be breaking unless you're using Kohana exactly how we are.

See [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) if you really want to try and use it.

And also [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). You really want to read that.
